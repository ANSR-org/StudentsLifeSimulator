# StudentsLifeSimulator

Students Life Simulator aims to simulate the experience of a student in an university, from the day they apply to an university, through the period of relocation, settlement and going regularly to university trainings and other events, until the decommision. The simulator is strongly gamified, makes it suitable either for regular curious guys or highly competitive spirits. Both parts learn the easy way the hard parts of life - surviving away from home in favor of education.

Ideally the simulator as a whole walks the player through all the obstacles one can clash with, such as the decision of university and their specialties, which hostel to live in, whether to attend a lecture, go to a coffee, work for some money, wait for a miracle, studying for exams and natively leveling up, taking the bachelor, but finding that the master is not that easy and so forth.

In the Proof of Concept version, only a small, but meaningful set of actions are available. Once the user registers, they have to choose an university, then apply to a specialy and answer a specific questions. Once they have applied to specialty, depending on the percentage of right answers, a fraction of 1000 virtual money are given to them. They can refill to 1000 by buying with existing currency using they credit cards. 

The specialty has a schedule - most of it set by the university authority, but some liberal arts are left to the student to schedule them.

Afterwards, they can choose a hostel by its stats (noise, distance from the university, pollution and rent price). It's a vital decision, since the noise can prevent the player from taking a good sleep, thus not receiving the full energy for sleeping. In fact, the game has three consumables: virtual money, energy and items (items can be administrated, but for PoC they are three). Every week the player receives from their family some of the items (e.g. compotes or sausages). These consumables can be spent in order to increase the energy. But also, they can be traded on the market for a price in the range of -20% to +20% of their nominal price.

The player also can go to lectures. They can't go earlier than 30% of the duration of a lecture and respectively being late for more than 30% of the duration. Each lecture freezes the player and they cannot do anything else, but being there. But it's in most of the cases a good decision to to a lecture, since every whole lecture gives more income of virtual money per hour. 

The tricky part is that each activity needs energy. If there's none or not enough, the player has to take some considerations. For instance, they can consume the compotes or go to sleep. The latter is a slow operation, which freezes the player for hours.
